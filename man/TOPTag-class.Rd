\title{TOPTag S4 class for storing top differential genes}
\usage{
\S4method{show}{TOPTag}(object)

filterGenes(object, names)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A TOPTag object.}

\item{names}{A character vector containing the names of the genes to be
filtered.}
}
\value{
A TOPTag object.
}
\description{
The TOPTag S4 class inherits the DETag class and is a more
             specific class for storing top differential genes. It contains
             all slots of the DETag class, with stringent filtering on the
             genes involved. Additional slots are added as a more convenient
             way for users to access the top differential genes.

The print method for the TOPTag class.

This function filters the top differential genes by a names
             vector. It is a convenient function for users to filter the
             top differential genes by a list of genes of interest.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{DEResult}}{A data frame containing the differential expression results
               for only the top differential genes. The columns resemble the
               predefined format in the DETag class. An additional column
               "rank" is added to indicate the rank of the gene in the
               differential expression results.
\itemize{
 \item {logFC}{The log fold change of the gene}
 \item {pvalue}{The p-value of the gene}
 \item {padj}{The adjusted p-value of the gene}
 \item {piValue}{The pi-value of the gene, calculated by the formula
                -log10(padj) * sign(logFC)}
 \item {rank}{The rank of the gene in the differential expression results.
              Positive for up-regulated genes and negative for down-
              regulated genes. A rank of 1 indicates the most up-regulated
              gene and a rank of -1 indicates the most down-regulated gene.}
}}

\item{\code{method}}{A character string indicating the method used to calculate the
differential expression results.}

\item{\code{normalizedCounts}}{A matrix containing the normalized counts for
only the top differential genes, consistent with the
the DEResult slot.}

\item{\code{logFCCutoff}}{A numeric value indicating the absolute log2 fold change
cutoff used to filter the differential expression results.}

\item{\code{pCutoff}}{A numeric value indicating the adjusted p-value cutoff used to
filter the differential expression results.}

\item{\code{topGenes}}{A numeric value indicating either the fraction (0-1) of top
differential genes or the number (1-Inf) of top differential
genes. If the number specified is greater than the number of
DE genes based on logFCCutoff and pCutoff, then topGenes will
be set to the number of DE genes.}
