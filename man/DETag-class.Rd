\title{DETag S4 class}
\description{
This class is used to store the differential expression analysis
             results for the count-based omics data. Although the
             functionality of the class itself can be easily implemented
             by using other data structures, here use specifically designed
             S4 class to allow future extension of the program, e.g.
             providing different methods for differential expression
             analysis while maintaining a consistent interface.
